I have a script to automate it, but I had to tweak it while handling
patches that cross a single subsystem boundaries, using git send-email
with the c/c list obtained from get_maintainers.pl.

By default, the script adds all maintainers, reviewers and all mailing
lists to the cover letter, but that sometimes generate a cover letter
with 80+ c/c, which will be automatically rejected by anti-spam
measures and by mail servers.

So, I played with two different alternatives:

1. At the beginning, I changed the script to c/c only the mailing lists,
   excluding maintainers/reviewers;
2. As the feedback was not great, I changed the script to c/c only
   the maintainers, excluding mailing lists/reviewers. It seems that
   this worked better.

I didn't try to play with bcc, as replying to it would not send
the replies to everyone.

If you think it is worth, I could submit it to scripts/, but I
suspect we may need to adjust it to work with all maintainers'
workflows.

Thanks,
Mauro
