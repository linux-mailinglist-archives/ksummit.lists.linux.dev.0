So, in substance, this seems fine to me.

Naturally I have some nits I'll point out below.  But if you're tired of
this I'm happy to apply this version as well, let me know.

For the record, going forward, I'm likely to treat proposed changes to
this file the way I do coding-style.rst - I'll be highly reluctant to
apply them without a strong sense of community consensus behind them.

It seems you have gone out of your way to avoid using "AI" and refer to
"tooling" in general, so it's a bit strange to see that term here,
especially at the head of a list of mostly non-AI tasks.

> + - Which portions of the content were affected by that tool?
> + - How is the submission tested and what tools were used to test the
> +   fix?
> +
> +As with all contributions, individual maintainers have discretion to

At some point, $SOMEBODY should probably add a brief reference to
submitting-patches.rst as well.

Thanks,
