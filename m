If they're sent only to the maintainers, not to the subsystem mailing
lists, they may be ignored, as no one but the maintainer will be aware.

Never send bug reports privately, unless you have a monetary
relationship with the receiving end.  Always Cc the subsystem
mailing list, so anyone involved can help.
