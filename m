Indeed:

	While the Constitution and Copyright Act do not explicitly define
	who (or what) may be an "author," U.S. courts to date have not
	recognized copyright in works that lack a human authorâ€”including
	works created autonomously by AI systems.

Please note the "U.S. courts *to* *date*".  :-(

Except that the USA is a case-law jurisdiction, and changes
in interpretation of existing laws can be and have been applied
retroactively, give or take things like statutes of limitations.  And we
need to worry about more than just USA law.

And I do agree that many of the lawsuits seem to be motivated by an
overwhelmening desire to monetize the output of AI that was induced by
someone else's prompts, if that is what you are getting at.  It does seem
to me personally that after you have sliced and diced the training data,
fair use should apply, but last I checked, fair use was a USA-only thing.

Agreed, in that case, it is well established that the AI output would
have at least one layer of copyright protection.
