And one huge distinction between the CoC and the support group is that the
support group will have absolutely zero authority to lay out any
consequences to all of the parties involved. Where as the CoC can if it
deems fit, escalate the ramifications if things do not move it a way it
feels necessary.

It's like having a family member that is abusing drugs. You go to a support
group to get help. You do not go to law enforcement, as that could escalate
to unintended consequences to the individual you want to help.

That alone will keep people from contacting CoC in some situations where a
support group could indeed help.

Look at Bart's reply to my email. He was concerned about leaving a trail in
some mailing list. That's the type of situation I want to address.
