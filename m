Very often this status is an issue by itself. It only serves to hide
the less interesting junk to discover what's left behind, but when
people continue to respond to resolved issues nobody sees that. And
if you block them from continuing to feed a closed issue, it's even
worse as it forces them to reopen a new one that causes duplication.

With e-mails you can respond to an old message if you want and keep
all the participants. And it does happen.

It's a convincing argument, for sure!

You've already claimed that and we've also told you that it could very
well have been the opposite and have been resolved in 6 months instead
of 2.5 years, by having many more eyes on it. The thing is that you're
only listening to yourself and not to the arguments that the people you
accuse of not reading the lists gave you. At this point there's not much
more that can be done, you've completely closed that discussion by
refusing to listen, thus I think it's better to stop now.
