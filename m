What happened that started this discussion was me reading about an AI patch
that was submitted and accepted without the maintainer knowing that the
patch was 100% created by AI. That maintainer just happened to be me! I
made a stink about not disclosing the fact that the patch was generated by
AI. I wanted full transparency.

A long discussion started there where we noticed that we have no written
policy on transparency of tooling used to create patches and wanted to fix
that. That was the reason this all started, but it expanded to "Oh we need
to document our policy on AI too". That was an after thought.

See why I'm still pushing to only document what our current policy is.

Why? We don't know what is going to happen. We are only assuming things are
going to be a problem, where it may never be.

But this document doesn't even say that. It's only expressing in writing
what our policy is on transparency of using tooling where AI is just one
more tool. AI submissions have already been done. It's only accepted after
the normal process is followed.
