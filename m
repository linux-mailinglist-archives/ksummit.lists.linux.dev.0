First three hits:

  1. Google just tripled its bounty for Linux kernel bugs. Here's
whyhttps://www.zdnet.com =E2=80=BA Innovation =E2=80=BA Security
     02 Nov 2021 =E2=80=94 Google has kicked off a special three-month bug
bounty targeting flaws in the Linux kernel with triple the rewards for
security researchers.

  2. Google's New Bug Bounties Include Their Custom Linux

     13 Aug 2022 =E2=80=94 All of GKE and its dependencies are in scope, bu=
t
every flag caught so far has been a container breakout through a Linux
kernel vulnerability.

  3. How to report Linux kernel bugs - google/syzkaller -
GitHubhttps://github.com =E2=80=BA syzkaller =E2=80=BA blob =E2=80=BA maste=
r =E2=80=BA docs
     Reporting Linux kernel bugs. Before reporting a bug make sure
nobody else already reported it. The easiest way to do this is to
search through the syzkaller ...

Bingo, that page tells you to use the MAINTAINERS file.
Nothing about bugzilla on the first page (Google is adapting quickly ;-)

During the last decade, I received three emails from kernel bugzilla
(four including the "please change your password" email).

The first one was incorrectly assigned to me, but closest as fixed
later.
The second was fixed by the reporter after feedback from someone else.
The third was a complex configuration issue (think randconfig) that
was not trivial to fix, but doesn't matter in the real world.

Now, for bug reports by email that I did fix, I cannot give you the
details easily, as the list would be a few orders of magnitude larger...
