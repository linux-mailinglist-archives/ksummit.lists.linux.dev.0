This topic seems to come up on an annual basis :)

As a follow up to last year's discussion[1] I wrote a bot[2] that is able to
analyze pull requests and respond with statistics about how long commits spent
in -next as well as on the mailing lists. An example of the reports it produces
is available here[3].

I haven't ended up receiving signal from Linus that it's useful and not a waste
of his time, so I stopped sending these mails out.
