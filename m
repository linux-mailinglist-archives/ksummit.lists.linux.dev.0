Thank you for that. As a lurker in this mail thread, I really appreciate
your efforts as they're saving the time I would need to argue as
strongly as you do :-)

While I agree with the argument that kernel documentation should not
cover every single hypothetical case that one could come up with, the
issue at hand here is real (based on the multiple people who have
replied saying they have seen it happen), and I don't think anyone
expects the problem to disappear magically given the industry trend.

It is also absolutely true that actors with questionable ethics will not
care about the documentation. I do see value in being able to point
developers acting in good faith to the rules, but an even more important
point in my opinion is the message your proposal gives to maintainers.

On a side note, I wonder if this is symptomatic of an erosion of trust
in this conflictual world, with some maintainers increasingly fearing
they will be forced or overridden.
