Funny thing.  I've largely given up on getting any kind of useful bug
report from Launchpad, so I've largely ignored it.  In contast, the
bug reports I get for e2fsprogs from Debian are generally far more
actionable, with bug reports that have all of the data so I can
actually root cause the problem, and help the user.

So Launchpad may be pretty, but perhaps because of selection bias, the
bug reports I've seen there are generally a waste of my time, and if
I'm going to choose which users I'm going to help for ***free***, it's
going to be the one which is far less frustrating to me as the
volunteer.

"100 times more popular" is not necessarily a feature if what we get
is 1000 times the noise.

Given my personal experience having seen bug repors from Launchpad,
I'm sure that's true.  The question is whether I want to engage with
people who can't me decent bug reports...  (or who are just asking for
free consulting help; there's a lot of that too).
