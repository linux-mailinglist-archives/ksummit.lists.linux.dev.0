The author's web page (https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/) says:

On the Feasibility of Stealthily Introducing Vulnerabilities in
Open-Source Software via Hypocrite Commits
Qiushi Wu, and Kangjie Lu.
To appear in Proceedings of the 42nd IEEE Symposium on Security and
Privacy (Oakland'21). Virtual conference, May 2021.
â˜… Note: The experiment did not introduce any bug or bug-introducing
commit into OSS. It demonstrated weaknesses in the patching process in a
safe way. No user was affected, and IRB exempt was issued. The experiment
actually fixed three real bugs. Please see the clarifications.
https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kjlu/papers/clarifications-hc.pdf

He's on the program committee of the conference for next year...
