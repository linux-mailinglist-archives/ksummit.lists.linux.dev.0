I think there's a general agreement that those tags are useful, should
be used, and are already widely used. Reminding everybody, be they
maintainers or not, is fine with me. Making this an extra strict duty
for maintainers, however, is something I can't support. We already have
a bad maintainer burnout problem, and this would make it worse,
resulting in a worse long term outcome in my opinion.

I would be more interested in exploring why regression fixes don't end
up in stable releases in a timely manner, and seeing how we could
improve that at no cost for maintainers. We may even be able to come up
with processes and tools that, when used right, would save time for
maintainers. That would have a higher chance of getting broader
adoption.
