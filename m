I saw this when James first posted it. I may have been the lone figure to
do so as I had to point it out when the topic came up a second time ;-)

I'm all for having this discussion under James topic, but this idea of a
Support Group is something I've been discussing with other maintainers for
some time. I believe I even mentioned it to you while on the bus in Dublin.

One of the things the TAB is working on is to come up with a "Communication
Style" document that will be focused on how submitters should speak to
maintainers and how maintainers should speak to submitters. The idea is to
help people understand the POV that others are coming from. But that's a
discussion for another day.

Anyway, with the majority of the [MAINTAINERS SUMMIT] submissions related
to this, I think it should definitely be discussed at the maintainers
summit.
