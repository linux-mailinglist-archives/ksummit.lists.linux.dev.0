Good :-D

There was a small, easily missed note about that in the long mail that
started this thread:

```
 * Initially it won't be possible to track reports that are filed in bug
trackers; but this use-case will be kept in mind during the design to
make sure such a functionality can be added later easily.
```

When I wrote that I mainly had the bug trackers used by the ACPI/PM and
DRM people in mind, but yes, making sure that it works for distro
tracker as well is a good point. Thx for bringing this to my attention.
And FWIW: I might leave that out initially, but I guess it won't take
too long before I will add this.

Ciao, Thorsten
