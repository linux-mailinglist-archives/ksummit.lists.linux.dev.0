OK ;-)

That's not that much different, as you only need to run "make localmodconfig"
once, as the first step (or as step zero, before starting the bisection).

Yeah, you may run into issues that are fixed in v5.18.15, but not in
v5.18 itself, or in later intermediate steps.
For a short range like v5.18.15 to v5.19.4 (which are not LTS, hence
didn't receive that many updates, which can be good or bad), I don't
expect many problems, though

There are similar (but much worse) issues with bisecting between two
linux-next releases.

Does it really save that much bandwidth?
How many minutes of 4K streaming video is the kernel nowadays? ;-)
