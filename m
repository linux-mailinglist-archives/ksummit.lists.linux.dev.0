So, merge window is over. To avoid any doubt, I'd now like to get a
clarification what the outcome of this discussion actually is.

FWIW, as most of you likely know, lwn.net has a write-up of this thread:

Is this the agreed on path forward by silent agreement? And if so: who
will actually shepherd this? I just wonder, as it sounded to me that
Konstantin would be happy to take care of the bot-related stuff, but
leave the rest to somebody else.

Or do we have two proposals on the table that are kind of deadlocked so
that nothing will happen until the next maintainers summit, where things
like this are usually discussed and a way forward agreed on? Then the
ugly situation with bugzilla.kernel.org would continue for afaics at
least 11 more months, which I'd call "unfortunate". :-/

Ciao, Thorsten
