I think most of us know the feeling. Personally, if my workload reaches
100% review for an extended period of time, without having any time for
"fun" activities such as hacking, I'm pretty sure my review efficiency
drops drastically. Maybe that's call burn out.

I've also experienced mixed results from "trading reviews". It's
certainly nice on paper, and it works sometimes, especially when asking
contributors to review patches that are directly related to their
business interest. I remember asking a contributor from a large company
to help me with reviews, to free some of my time to review their
patches. The contributor helped with reviewing third-party contributions
to the driver they're actively working on. When I asked for help
reviewing an entirely separate driver that their employer had no
business interest in, however, I faced the "we're busy and don't have
time" argument.

Maybe part of the solution here, to share the maintenance burden, is to
expect contributors, especially the ones with large financial resources,
to spent a certain percentage of their time reviewing code that is in
their area of expertise but not in their area of business interest.
