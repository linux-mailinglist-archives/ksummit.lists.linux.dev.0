Well, Red Hat apparently is already in the process of migrating to Jira
in the long run:
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/epel-devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/U7TZRWXVUGBCHS6EBJIBSFAVPFUHHV7J/

To quote that mail from March:

```
As some of you may know, Red Hat has been using both Bugzilla and Jira
via issues.redhat.com for RHEL development for several years.  Our
intention is to move to using issues.redhat.com only for the major
RHEL releases after RHEL 9.
```

Ciao, Thorsten
