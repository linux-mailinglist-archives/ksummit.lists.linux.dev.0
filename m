Get a better e-mail client ? ;-) At least with e-mail you have a choice
between different clients.

I've refrained from replying to this thread so far, as it seemed to be a
caricature of a bikeshedding discussion, but for what it's worth, I
often find myself in the opposite situation when I'm annoyed that
someone trimmed too much of the discussion in their replies.

Yes, replying to a 3000-lines patches with a full quote ana d a
Reviewed-by tag at the very bottom, without any other comment, is
annoying. On the other hand, trimming everything but the few lines to
which you reply means that it gets much more annoying to jump in the
discussion in the middle of a mail thread. There's a difference between
trimming unrelated parts, and removing related content that happens not
to be the direct subject of a particular reply.
