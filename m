Because the approach is wrong. As I explained it gives a false sense to
the reporter that their issue is being handled while the simple fact that
a message was sent to a person is in no way an engagement to do anything
about it. LKML is a broadcast area. Everyone hopes someone else will
respond and that eventually happens. When the reports are targetted, it
puts pressure on the few developers receiving the message who know that
it's unlikely anyone else will deal with that report.

Because it's easy to ignore. Try to setup this conversation in your
favorite bug tracker and you'll feel alone discussing with yourself.
This is a great indication that participation is much more powerful
in the mailing list model than in the bug tracker model.
