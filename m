Serious ? Have you ever attended a conference and looked over the
shoulder of the person in front of you ? There are 3 types of interfaces
you see:
  - code
  - slides
  - mails

The last thing people will look at during a conference definitely is a
painfully depressive bugtracker interface. However they will see bug
reports in their mailbox as they happen to read emails from their boss
or customers.

You don't have such a problem with email. It only happens when you try
to respond via e-mail to stuff you find in a browser.
