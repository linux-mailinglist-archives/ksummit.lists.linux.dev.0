The premise of the document is good.  I offered a couple of suggestions;
however, even if they aren't accepted, the document LGTM.

Parsing ... okay, that took a few goes.  How about:

  Even if disclosure of your tool isn't mandated, providing this context
  often helps reviewers evaluate your contribution more effectively.
  Clear documentation of your workflow ensures a faster review with less
  contention.

Nit: Suggest removing the sporadic use of full-stops (periods) across all lists.

Or add them everywhere - so long as it's consistent.
