Well, I'd disagree partially with that, as my regression tracking bot
"regzbot"
(https://gitlab.com/knurd42/regzbot/-/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md
; https://linux-regtracking.leemhuis.info/regzbot/mainline/) does
exactly does that: tracking, by connect the dots (e.g. monitoring
replies to a report as well recording when patches are posted or
committed that link to the report using Link: tags), while making sure
nothing important is forgotten. But sure, it's still very rough and
definitely not a full bug-tracker (my goal is/was to not create yet
another one) and needs quite a bit of hand holding from my side. And I
only use it for regressions and not for bugs (on purpose).

Ciao, Thorsten
