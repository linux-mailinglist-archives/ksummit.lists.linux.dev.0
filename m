I do see the advantage, but the main disadvantage here is that it's 
eroding trust between people. Anonymous review tends to be used for
negative feedback, and I am aware that negative feedback to maintainers
can have a direct impact on your ability to work in that subsystem
(and believe me, I have been in that position. Several times.)
But in the end if you want to continue to work in that subsystem
you have to come to some sort of arrangement here.
I do believe that our maintainers are capable of differentiating
between personal and technical issues, so it should be possible
to work together despite personal ... (issues? differences?).

But none of the above will work if the feedback is anonymously.
Maintainer will have a reason for reacting that way, and won't
be able to explain themselves properly if they don't know whom
to address.

Cheers,

Hannes
