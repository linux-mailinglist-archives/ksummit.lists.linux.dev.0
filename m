What permissions/rights does the AI module have such that it can create
a file in shared/photos/faces from my personal files?
The shared file with my photo is still owned by the sharing user, correct?
What are the permissions/owner of the parent directory?

What permissions are required in my personal photos directory to allow
files there to be shared?

It sounds to me like the AI was aggressive in sharing; now you (the user)
want to correct/fix that. The AI could be trained better, but that's too
difficult. (just playing devil's advocate there)

I haven't looked at this in any detail, but I'm wondering if an
intermediate directory level with "my" permissions/ownership would
allow a fix for this issue. Then I (the user) could remove the file
(the hardlink) from the intermediate directory. However, that might
leave some dangling link in the final shared directory. I don't know
enough about it to answer that.

Do you have control over the AI that does this photo directory magic?

Anyway, it sounds like a reasonable topic for the kernel summit (as a
Tech Topic) instead of the maintainer's summit (process stuff).
