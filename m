I wish that were the case, unfortunately it is quite rare that
maintainers of subsystems of the kernel are allowed to work on upstream
issues like this all the time.  Heck, part of the time would be
wonderful too, but that is also quite rare.  So while maintainers would
love to be able to work like this, getting their management to agree to
this is not very common, sadly.

bugzilla.kernel.org is _hosted_ by the LF, and does a great job of
keeping it running and alive.  The LF has nothing to do with the content
of the bugs in it, the reporting, the response of people to reported
bugs, assigning bugs to anyone, getting them fixed, or anything else
related to the content in the database at all.  Please don't get
confused with the resources provided to host the system vs. the people
who actually do the kernel development itself.

Note, the LF does sponsor a few kernel developers to do work on the
kernel, including myself, but we are a tiny drop in the bucket compared
to the 4000+ developers who contribute to the kernel every year.

thanks,
