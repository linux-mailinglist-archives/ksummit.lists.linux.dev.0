For loads of reasons that have been stated before, we aren't going to
move everything to gitlab, sorry.  That's a non-starter for a wide range
of reasons, not the least being you are trying to solve a "we have no
one who wants to wrangle bugs in bugzilla" problem with "move all of our
code hosting infrastructure to a totally different thing that can't even
provide the basic things that we have today".

Sorry, not going to happen, gitlab is not the solution here.
