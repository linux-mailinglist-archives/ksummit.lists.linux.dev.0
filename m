I like it.

I'll repeat here what I mentioned in my other email. Those that send the
slop are NOT GOING TO READ THIS. The ones that are going to read this are
the ones trying to do the right thing.

I don't think this is too subtle. It basically tells honest contributors
what to expect. It doesn't have to be a "Do this or else!" document.

As I mentioned before. This is to clarify what we expect. Some people may
be harsher on AI slop than others. We don't need to make this document at
the tone of those that hate AI slop the most.

I want the tone to be aimed at people who want to know how to submit
something. Not a tone at those that are going to be doing it wrong *because
they didn't read any documents*.

I'm pretty sure this document does not express that. Even when being more "soft".

Reading the comments appears to show that most people think AI is mostly
over hyped.

And those people are exactly who will likely not read this document!

As I stated before. This wasn't the purpose of the document.

Honestly, if it gets worse, I would suggest creating a separate document
specifically about AI. This document is just writing down the unwritten
rules we already have with tool-generated content. This document includes
coccinelle and checkpatch.

If we need a "AI slop go away!" document, that should be a separate one.

Feel free to create that and submit an RFC ;-)
