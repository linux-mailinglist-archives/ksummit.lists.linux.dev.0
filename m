Trust does play a large role here. I get annoyed when someone I never heard
of sends me a patch because a tool told them it was wrong but when looking
at the code, the tool was wrong.

Every so often Dan sends me one of these types of patches because of a
false positive in smatch or something like that. But Dan also sends me
overwhelming more patches that actual fix real bugs. The signal to noise
ratio is rather high with Dan so I never get annoyed from a missed patch
here or there.

But someone I never heard of sending me one of these are totally annoying
as the signal to noise ratio is 0 for them :-p

But were these all tool submissions?

I also wouldn't expect (or particularly want) new contributors doing
reviews. I think "Reported-by" is a much better metric for new submitters.
I trust people who found real bugs more than people that just slap their
"Reviewed-by" tag on something they probably don't understand.
