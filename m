Sometimes there are days where I think "let's go down the 'do everything
by mail' rabbit hole some more and couple a pastebin and a somewhat
improved regzbot with an app (usable both locally and on the web) that
helps users preparing a report they can then send with their usual
mailer". And then there are days "ohh, no, that might be a totally
stupid thing to do". :-/

I think having some app would be good here, as it could help gathering
everything and catch problems early, to prevent users from spending a
lot of time on preparing a report that will be ignored.

Tell me about it. Nevertheless I sometimes wonder if I should give it a
try once I got all this regression tracking thing established somewhat
more, as in the end there I'm kind of a bugmaster for regressions already...

Just to be sure: I assume you meant "replacing bugzilla or fixing it for
real" here, and not my band-aid efforts outlined at the start of this
thread? Or do you have a problem with what I proposed to at least make
things less bad for now?
