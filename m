E-mails are not that bad to report issues, but they can't provide the
core feature that any bug tracker oughts to have: tracking. There's no
way, with the tools we have at the moment (including public-inbox, b4
and lei), to track the status of bug reports and fixes. Even for patches
we need to rely on patchwork, and that's far from perfect.

When things fall through the cracks (and at the moment it's more of a
sieve with very large holes, if not a bottom-less pot), we mostly assume
that, if the problem is important enough, the submitter will ping time
after time until a fix is produced and merged. There is no way to
produce a list of open issues.

I agree with the comment that was repeated multiple times: it's quite
pointless to improve the tooling if we don't first improve the process,
and find a way to allocate people and time to handling bug reports. Even
if bugzilla has reached EOL upstream, and even if it isn't perfect, the
instance runs today, and gives us a tracker that could be used to design
a proper process and implement it, should we desire to do so. There's no
chicken-and-egg issue to be solved where lack of tooling would prevent
the implementation of a bug tracking process. I'm quite confident that,
if we manage to implement a bug tracking process, we will find a way to
get the tooling we need, be it through bugzilla or something else.
