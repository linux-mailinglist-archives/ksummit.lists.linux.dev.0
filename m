Not really.  Staging is for "stuff that is not cleaned up yet and we
want to do that work in-tree".  It's best for existing code bases that
have been around for a while to get dropped in there and take advantage
of people wanting to do simple "first task" type of kernel patches
(coding style cleanups, shim layer removals, spelling fixes.)

It's almost never a good idea to use staging for a new subsystem as the
work it takes to get it merged out of staging is almost always more than
it would be to just do "all of the coding style cleanups first" out of
the tree and then merge it properly.

So I do not recommend staging for anything with an "active" developer
community, as it would just slow down the acceptance of the code to the
real part of the kernel.

Totally agreed.
