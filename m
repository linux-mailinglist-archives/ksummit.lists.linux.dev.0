Rust can't do full theorem proving. You can do quite a bit with the
borrow checker and other type system enhancements, but you definitely
can't do everything.

So if the compiler can't prove something at compile time, you may need a
runtime check to avoid undefined behaviour.

And the fact that Rust eliminates undefined behaviour in safe code is
huge. That's really a fundamental prerequisite for anything that would
be meaningfully better than C, and Rust gets that right.

(which required the borrow checker, because memory safety = UB...)

That means that even if you don't know if your code is correct, it's at
least going to fail in predictable ways. You're going to get meaningful
backtraces, good error messages if you weren't horribly lazy (the Rust
Display trait makes that a lot more ergonomic) - that means no more two
week bisect + bughunts for a UAF that was silently corrupting data.

We _just_ had one of those. Just the initial bisect (and it turned out
to be in the fuse code) interrupted the work I and a user were doing to
test bcachefs fsck scalability for a full week, when we'd just dedicated
and setup a machine for that that we only had for a limited time.

That sucked: there's a massive hidden cost to the sorts of heisenbugs
that C allows.

Of course higher level logic errors could still result in a silent
data corruption bug in Rust: intelligent thought is still required,
until we climb the next mountain, and the next mountain, until we do get
to full correctness proofs (and then we still have to write the code).

I don't expect such issues to affect us normal kernel developers much.
Yes, the compiler folks have a lot to deal with, but "can it build the
kernel" is an easy thing to add to their automated testing pipeline.

And it's not like we never have to deal with compiler issues now.

If you want a real mental trip, consider that a type system powerful
enough for theorem proving must itself be turing complete (not
inherently, but in practice), and thus the halting problem applies to
"can the compiler even process its inputs without terminating?".

But compiler folks have been dealing with such issues for years already,
that's their ballgame.
