I really think we should just recommend the user to *consider* using:

Generated-by

I've been using it for Coccinelle on Linux for years, and it was not
just me. In other projects, in particular kdevops we started using this
to also be clear about the use of AI tools, and I've found it
instrumental to keep track of how much code *does not use it*.

A long time ago we evaluated the question of using git notes for
coccinelle used input, and the issue back then was we didn't have support
for it I think. But I think that hump is gone?

If so, would using git notes for prompts be useful in this case as we scale
tooling outside of Coccinelle, like AI prompts? I believe this can be
instrumental for enhancing LLMs as well for fine tuned LLMs for Linux
development.

Otherwise, looks good.
