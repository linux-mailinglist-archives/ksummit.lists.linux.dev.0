And even though I'm arguing with Lorenzo, I appreciate him giving his
feedback. I'm not at all frustrated with him, and his arguments help me
understand my own ideas about this document.

I'm actually not against a document that is all about AI slop. I'm just
against hijacking this document into being that. This wasn't the purpose of
this document. In the TAB, where we started discussing this (and I was
supposed to be the one that wrote the first version, but thankfully Dave
did a great job at getting it going). The focus was to be to document what
we currently do in practice when it comes to tool-generated content. Notice
that the subject of this document doesn't even mention AI.

I personally (and I hope others do too) want to keep this document focused
on transparency when it comes to tool-generated content which also includes
testing and such.

Now, in the future there may be a need for a harsher document to cover AI
slop. I just don't want it to be this document.

I don't think AI is just another tool, but in this document it is, as the
focus was to talk about all tooling that generates patches (which is
everything from sed scripts to AI). I don't want this document to be
focused on AI at all.

If you want something to point to when you receive AI slop, create a
separate document that is for that purpose only. It will keep this document
clearer and also be more useful to the one that needs to read the AI slop
document, as it will be explicitly for them.
