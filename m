With the band-aids you outline in place: do you think it would it be =
beneficial to have a liaison holding users=E2=80=99s hands through the =
process, _then_ triaging to developers by contacting them with the =
information they need? (This is something proposed previously on this =
thread[1], and something I=E2=80=99ve already said I=E2=80=99m willing =
to do[2][3].)

IOW, someone to bridge between end users and developers and (at least =
try to) help bring some order to the chaos.

Thanks,
-srw
