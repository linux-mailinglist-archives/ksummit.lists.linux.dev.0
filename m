If it is AI slop coming in, you can say, "unless you can prove to me that
you understand this series and there's nothing wrong with it, I'm rejecting
it"

If the series looks good then what's the issue. But if it's AI slop and
it's obvious the person behind the code doesn't understand what they are
submitting, that could even be rationale for sending that person to your
/dev/null folder.

Are you noticing this in submissions?

This document is not about addressing anything that we fear will happen. It
is only to state our current view of how things work today.

If the floodgates do open and we get inundated with AI slop, then we can
most definitely update his document to have a bit more teeth.

But one thing I learned about my decade on the TAB, is don't worry about
things you are afraid might happen, just make sure you address what is
currently happening. Especially when it's easy to update the rules.

Why does this need to be added to the document. I think we should only be
addressing how we handle tool generated content.

I don't believe that is necessary. I reject patches outright all the time.
Especially checkpatch "fixes" on code that is already in the tree. I just
say: "checkpatch is for patches, not accepted content. If it's not a real
bug, don't use checkpatch."

If the AI code is decent, why reject it? If it's slop, then yeah, you have
a lot of reasons to reject it.

If it's AI slop, then I'm sure you could easily find lots of technical
justifications for rejecting it. Why do we need to explicitly state it
here?.

Is it trivial just because it's checkpatch? I gave another example above
too. But if AI slop is coming in, I'm sure there's lots of reasons to
reject it.

Are you saying that if there's good AI code coming in (I wouldn't call it
slop then) that you want to outright reject it too?

Then why not come up with a list of reasons AI slop is bad and make a
boiler plate and send that every time. Basically states that if you submit
AI code, the burden is on the submitter to prove that they understand the
code. Or would you like that explicitly stated in this document? Something
like:

- If you submit any type of tool generated code, then it is the
  responsibility of the submitter to prove to the maintainer that they
  understand the code that they are submitting. Otherwise the maintainer
  may simply reject the changes outright.

?

I don't think this document's goal was to be a pointer to show people why
you are rejecting AI submissions. This is just a guideline to how tool
generated code should be submitted.

It's about how things work today. It's not about how things will work going
forward with AI submissions. That document is for another day.
