Thx for saying this, as I fear it in the end will again be more work
then anticipated -- but well, that's how life often is :-D

Ohh, yeah, sorry, should have mentioned this. Don't worry, I'm aware of
this particular and a few similar products/components in bugzilla. I
don't plan changing any of them, unless something unforeseen or a very
good reason comes up (for example if they're obviously unused for years
or something like that).

Ciao, Thorsten
