We discussed having a mailing list and came up with the conclusion that any
mailing list would be a bad idea. The biggest reason against it is if
someone is getting frustrated with one of the volunteers. We want a way for
them to be able to choose exactly who gets to see what they want to say,
and more importantly, who doesn't get to see it.

As things should be kept confidential, I would not want to put the pressure
on the volunteer to have to keep something confidential that they
shouldn't. The guidelines should state that although rants may be allowed,
any threat of violence or other illegal activities mentioned in the
correspondence will not remain private. This would allow volunteers to
report any threats without feeling that they are breaking the
confidentiality pledge.
